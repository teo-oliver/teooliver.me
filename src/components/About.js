      <p>
        I am full stack web developer. I used to work with sound for movies and
        games, but with time I got more and more interested in the programming
        part of it.
        <br />
        I've worked with Unreal Engine and Unity but my passion for web
        development led me to invest most of my programing time in Javascript,
        C# and Typescript.
