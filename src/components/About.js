        I used to work doing sound for movies and tv but with time I got more
        and more interested in the programming part of it wich led me to work
        with games and then to web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 10 years working in the music industry I decided to go fulltime as
        a programmer and leave music as a hobby. I love learning new
        technologies and languages and I'm always up for new challenges.
