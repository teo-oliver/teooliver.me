      <p>
        I used to work doing sound for movies and tv but with time I got more
        and more interested in the programming part of it wich led me to work
        with games and then to web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve played with a lot of front-end libraries and frameworks but React
        is my preferred one. Because of that I got into the MERN stack.
      </p>
      <p>Now I'm looking for a full-time job as a front-end developer.</p>
